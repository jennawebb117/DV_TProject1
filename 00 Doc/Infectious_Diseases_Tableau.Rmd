For this project, we found a set of data that listed cases of different infectious dieases in various counties in California, as well as the total population of each county. It included how many males and females were infected per year, as well as the total number of infections per county per year.

These crosstabs display how many people per county were infected with some disease, broken down by males and females, as well as the two combined. The county called "California" is the total of all of the counties. Some counties to note are Alameda, where a significantly larger amount of females had diseases versus males, and the same is true for Fresno. Modoc had very few total diseases, as well as Alpine.
